### :small_orange_diamond: Before you do anything...

:star: Do not just take the `user.js` and use it as is. It's a template, treat it as such. Much has gone into making the defaults responsible and to not put anyone at risk. At worst, you will get some inconvenience and breakage (to be expected with a fairly hardened setup). Everyone's mileage will differ, and you can undo things that "break" (except deleted items like cookies and history: read the entire page!).

Also:
- Read the [overview](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/1.1-Overview). It is important to understand how a `user.js` works.
- Learn how to find and [back up](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/1.2-Backing-Up) your profile(s)
- If you already have a `user.js`, consider using [Compare-UserJS](https://github.com/claustromaniac/Compare-UserJS), an excellent tool to compare user.js files and output the diffs in detailed breakdown - developed by our very own resident cat, [claustromaniac](https://github.com/claustromaniac) :cat2: 

### :small_orange_diamond: At a bare minimum...

You will need to make changes. Make sure to read about applying `overrides` on [this](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/3.2-Applying-Your-Changes) wiki page.

:exclamation: ULTRA UBER IMPORTANT: Pay attention!

- We disable binary checks not in Safe Browsing local lists (0403)
  * :warning: If you do **not** understand the consequences of this, please change this setting
- Auto-installing of Firefox updates is disabled (0301)
  * :star: You will **always get prompts** and reminders from Firefox
  * Please keep your software up to date in a timely fashion

:exclamation: SUPER IMPORTANT: First Party Isolation (FPI), privacy.resistFingerprinting (RFP)

- FPI is enabled (4001)
  * It is recommended that you clear (Ctrl-Shift-Del) everything (except passwords) when first enabling (or permanently disabling) this, so orphaned Origin Attribute data is cleared
- RFP is enabled (4501) and webGL is disabled (4520)
   * :eyes: The **letterboxing pref** `4504` is independent of `4501`. FYI: this is the pref that creates borders around your webpages: if you want dark borders, use the hidden pref `ui.systemUsesDarkTheme` = `1`

:exclamation: QUITE IMPORTANT: Change to suit

- We disable session restore (0102)
  * :star: If you rely on session restore you had better change this, see our [override recipe](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues/1080)
- We delete cookies and history (download, form and browsing histories) on close
  * :star: Make changes to section 2800 to your liking
- We disable search & form history (0811)
  * :star: Form data can easily be stolen by third parties
     - see this 2017 [article](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2017/12/27/no-boundaries-for-user-identities-web-trackers-exploit-browser-login-managers/) and these [bugzillas](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=1443083,1427543)
     - see this 2011 [article](https://blog.mindedsecurity.com/2011/10/autocompleteagain.html) and this [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/381681)
- We disable automatic search from the urlbar (0801)
  * :star: You can still use search buttons and keyword shortcuts
- We disable WebRTC (2001)
  * :star: if you use WebRTC, see our [override recipe](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues/1080)
- We hardened cross origin referers (1601)
  * :star: This may cause breakage where third party images and videos may not load
  * Change to suit and consider installing an extension

:exclamation: OTHER: Other preferences may cause site breakage, but nothing that can't be fixed. You won't "lose" anything...- it's not the end of the world.

- Check our [override recipes](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/issues/1080)
- While not 100% definitive, we have included `[SETUP*` tags for troubleshooting and setting up. Search for `[SETUP` in the `user.js`. Choose wisely, there is always a **trade-off**. Some examples
   * `[SETUP-WEB]` can cause some websites to break
   * `[SETUP-CHROME]` changes how Firefox itself behaves (i.e. NOT directly website related)
   * `[SETUP-PERF]` may impact performance
- There is a deprecated section (9999)
   * You can reset these prefs in about:config if they no longer apply to your Firefox release

### :small_orange_diamond: Decide on a strategy...

So you have a `user.js`, you know how it all works, and you have checked and made a few changes. Now you can choose what profile to use. You can read all about working with [profiles](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/2.1-Multiple-Profiles) and [portable profiles](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/2.2-Multiple-Profiles-%5BFirefox-Portable%5D) and also how to run [concurrent profiles](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/2.3-Concurrent-Profiles) right here in this wiki.

Either use a new profile for testing or use your current profile (back it up first). The only other consideration would be how much of the `user.js` to introduce. You could either add the whole thing in one hit, or just add a few sections every so often. To be honest, there are probably less than a dozen settings that "break" a few sites functionality and they are easily reset.

Good luck, and don't be afraid to ask for help.
